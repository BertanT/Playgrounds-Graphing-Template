 # Playgrounds-Graphing-Template
A clean copy of the Apple’s now unavailable Graphing Template for the Swift Playgrounds. I really like this template and anyone else who does too is more than welcome to download it here!

**Do note that this template is mostly intended for quick experimentation. If you are working on a bigger project thet required charts and graphs, please consider using [Apple’s latest Swift Charts Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) instead.**
